# 🌷 **Hi, I'm Beyza**
*A computer science engineer with multidisciplinary depth.*

I am majoring in **Computer Engineering (CS)** and completing a second major in **Molecular Biology & Genetics**, which allows me to integrate computational thinking with real scientific complexity.

My work spans **enterprise network engineering, artificial intelligence, biomedical image analysis, robotics, and embedded systems** — building systems that are reliable, intelligent, and beautifully engineered.

I don’t “pick a field.”  
I build at the intersection of *all of them.*

# 🌸 **Who I Am?**

A builder of systems that combine:

- 🌱 biology → into intelligence  
- 🧩 hardware → into software  
- 🌐 networks → into living architecture  
- 🤖 robotics → into autonomy  

My work lives where complexity becomes *graceful.*
